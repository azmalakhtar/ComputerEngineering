## Action Bar

Appears at the top of the application screen. Contains application branding and navigation features such as the overflow menu and the application drawer button.
- The key functions of the app bar are as follows:
    - Dedicated space for giving your app an identity and indicating the user's location in the app.
    - Predictable access to important actions, such as search.
    - Support for navigation and view switching, using tabs or menus.

## Up Button
Appears in the action bar and takes us back through previous screens the user has navigated to within the app.

## Overflow Menu
A drop down list of items within the Action bar that can contain navigation destinations.

## Navigation Drawer
A menu with a header that slides out from the side of the app

# Fragments
- A `Fragment` represents a reusable portion of your app's UI.
- It defines and manages its own layout, has its own lifecycle, and can handle its own input events.
- Fragments can't live on their own. They must be hosted by an activity or another fragment. 
- The fragments's view hierarchy becomes part of, or attaches to, the host's view hierarchy.
